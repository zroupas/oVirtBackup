# oVirtBackup

**WARNING: This forked and I currently use branch 4.3 with oVirt 4.5 which is working as expected after some changes found in the related branch

This is a tool, written in Python, to make **online** fullbackup's of a VM which runs in an oVirt environment.

**WARNING: This release has to be tested with oVirt 4.4. For oVirt 4.3 please take a look the the branches.**

## Requirements

It is necessary to install the oVirt Python-sdk.
In addition when running Pyhon < 2.7 you need you install argparse.

[http://www.ovirt.org/Python-sdk](http://www.ovirt.org/Python-sdk)

## Usage

Take a look at the usage text.

    backup.py -h

## Configuration

Take a look at the example "config_example.cfg"

Please avoid Cirillic symbols in the configuration otherwise you will get an exception see [#59](https://github.com/wefixit-AT/oVirtBackup/issues/59)

## Workflow

* Create a snapshot
* Clone the snapshot into a new VM
* Delete the snapshot
* Delete previous backups (if set)
* Export the VM to the NFS share
* Delete the VM

## Useful tips

### crontab

	00  20  *   *   *   /home/backup/oVirtBackup.git/backup.py -c /home/backup/oVirtBackup.git/config_webserver.cfg -d >> /var/log/oVirtBackup/webserver.log 

Logrotate: /etc/logrotate.d/oVirtBackup

	/var/log/oVirtBackup/* {
    	daily
    	rotate 14
    	compress
    	delaycompress
    	missingok
    	notifempty
	}
	
### Security

Set permissions to config.cfg only for the needed user (chmod 600 config.cfg).

## TODO's

* When the ovirtsdk supports exporting a snapshot directly to a domain, the step of a VM creation can be removed to save some disk space during backup
